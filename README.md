# Scripts done as prjects or homeworks during MSc in Photonics

Ag.txt &

Au.txt &

Cr.txt - files containing data of wavelength, real part of refractive index and imaginary part of refractive index for Gold, Silver and Chromium mirror coatings used in "HomeworkEMLight.py"


# Matlab scripts



Bragg_mirror.m - analysis of Bragg mirrors

em_transmission.m - function takes refrcation indexes of layers and calculates kx, ky, incident angle 'fi', and absorbtion coefficient 'a' checking on observation of evanescent waves

WojciechRogala_HomeworkDigitalholography.m - reconstruction of propagated holographic images


# Pyhon scripts
